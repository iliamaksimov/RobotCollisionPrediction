# RobotCollisionPrediction
A Neural Network that helps a small robot navigate a simulated environment without any collisions. The NN is trained in PyTorch using Adam algorithm and predicts whether the robot is going to collide with any walls or objects in the next time step. This is a university coursework project.

## What I Learned
* Collect and manage a dataset used to train and test a neural network for a robotics task.
* Prune collected data to balance out its distribution
* Design your own neural network architecture in PyTorch.
* Evaluate and improve a neural network model and verify an application in simulation.
